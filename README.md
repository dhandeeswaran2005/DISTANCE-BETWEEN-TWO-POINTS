# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
Assign the given values  to x and y
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
According to the formula the code runs
### Step 5: 
use .2f to display 2 decimal point.
### Step 6:
Stop the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x = [4,2]
y = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt( ((x[0]-y[0])**2)+((x[1]-y[1]**2) )
Distance = format(distance,".2f")
print(Distance)
```  
### OUTPUT:
